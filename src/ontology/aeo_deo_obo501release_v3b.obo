The fourth cleavage took place simultaneously in the animal and the vegetal hemisphere, although it occurred differently. In the animal hemisphere, the four cells divided meridionally producing eight blastomeres of equal volume and arrayed in rosette. These cells are called the mesomeres. In the vegetal hemisphere, by contrast, the four cells underwent an unequal, equatorial cleavage that produced four large cells, the macromeres, and four small cells, the micromeres. At the 16-cell stage, the embryo is hence composed of three groups of cells with distinct sizes. It represents, in most sea urchin species, the first embryonic stage at which the first morphological indicator of the animal-vegetal axis becomes visible, with the smallest cells marking the vegetal pole.

def: "The embryo is composed of about 300 cells and is surrounded by a fertilization envelope. Additional cell divisions took place leading to an embryo with overall a larger number of small cells. Compared to previous blastula stages, the cells have slightly flattened on their inner, basal surface, further contributing to the enlargement of the blastocoel. In addition, the cells have by now started growing cilia on their outer surface. Despite these changes, the embryo is however still perfectly spherical and of about 90 µm in diameter. It still does not display any particular morphological landmark allowing orienting it along the primary or secondary embryonic axes. In addition, at that stage, molecular labeling surveys classically reveal in the vegetal hemisphere the presence of 16 to 32 large micromere descendant cells and of 4 to 8 small micromere descendant cells.

def: "The embryo is mainly characterized morphologically by a slight embedding of the vegetal plate within the blastocoel and the repartition of the skeletogenic mesenchyme cells all around this invaginated structure. Within the vegetal plate, the cells have reinforced their adhesive properties and undergone important cell shape changes thereby leading to the bending inward of the vegetal plate. This bending inward has by means generated the blastopore, i.e. the first opening of the embryo that will later give rise to the larval anus. Furthermore, it initiated the invagination of the archenteron (i.e. the primitive digestive tract). In sea urchin, this initial process is hence launched by the non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells. In parallel, within the blastocoel, the skeletogenic mesenchyme cells have by now adopted a characteristic pattern, being positioned as a ring all around the basis of the nascent archenteron.

By contrast, on the opposite side, the aboral (or dorsal) ectoderm has round up and slightly elongated, thereby forming the primitive apex of the future larvae. These changes have conferred the embryo a typical and easy recognizable triangular shape. In the oral ectoderm, a small depression has further appeared, called the stomodeum, which will later fuse with the tip of the archenteron to form the mouth. In the blastocoel, the digestive tract has also by now bended toward the stomodeum and started to become tripartite. The cardiac sphincter has started forming, separating the future esophagus from the future stomach. The triradiate spicules have also continued elongating, thereby forming by now, towards the animal pole, the right and left dorsoventral connecting rods, towards the apex, the body rods, and along the vegetal, oral ectoderm the left and right ventral transverse rods. Moreover, some non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells (or NSM cells, secondary mesenchyme cells or SMC) have started becoming pigmented and inserted into the aboral ectoderm. These cells represent part of the future immune system of the larvae along with other blastocoelar cells that are present in the blastocoel around the gut. In the vicinity of the future esophagus, other non-skeletogenic mesoderm descendant cells along with some endoderm cells have further arranged to form a single unpaired coelomic pouch. At the animal pole, the apical pole domain has also started to flatten making the embryo look like a square when viewed from the oral side, and it still arbors a tuft a long and immotile cilia. Finally, within the apical pole domain, but not yet in the ciliary band, molecular labeling surveys also start by this stage to reveal the presence of differentiating neuronal cells. "

Finally, the apical tuft previously observed at the animal pole has by now disappeared, leaving behind only the concentrated stretch of intermediate size cilia borne by the ciliary band. "

The larva has indeed extended on the ventral side two additional posterodorsal arms and has developed on the anterior side an additional skeletal element called the dorsal arch. In addition, at the basis of the postoral and posterodorsal arms, four small patches of ciliary band have by now cut off and migrated toward the apex, forming four patches of ciliated structures called the epaulettes (one posterior and one anterior pair). The nervous system of the larva has also become more complex with cell bodies and axons being present all along the arms and for the latter as well throughout the apex. The left and right coelomic pouches have continued to elongate on each side of the digestive tract. As a note this stage is relatively fleeting. "

def: "The 8-arm pluteus larva is mainly characterized morphologically by the presence on the ventral side of the larva of eight arms and by the development within the larva, on the left side of the stomach, of the adult rudiment. This stage is relatively long. It includes distinct changes occurring to the larva as well as within the larva, although the larva consistently exhibits 8 arms. In addition, it should be highlighted that the sequence of events taking place at the level of the larva compared to that occurring on the left side of the stomach to form the rudiment are heterochronic, meaning that differences are observed among individuals in the relative timing of these events. From the larval point of view, at that stage, on the anterior side, the dorsal arch has extended out of the oral hood, thereby forming two additional arms above the mouth, i.e. the preoral arms. In parallel, across the apex, the epaulettes have continued developing, thereby generating four large structures rich in cilia and perpendicular to the ventro-dorsal axis. At the tip of the apex, the suture of the body rods has also eventually ruptured, considerably enlarging the larval apex and reducing the angle between the postoral and posterodorsal arms. In parallel, inside the larva, the left coelomic pouch has also by now been partitioned into three parts: the axocoel (upper part, close to the esophagus), the hydrocoel (middle part) and the somatocoel (lower part, next to the stomach). Likewise, on the opposite side, the right coelomic pouch has also been partitioned into a right axohydrocoel and a right somatocoel, although the right axohydrocoel remains in a rudimentary state compared to its left counterparts. In addition, at the basis of the posterodorsal arm on the left side, a small portion of the ectoderm has thickened, invaginated, and came into contact with the left hydocoel. This structure is called the vestibule and together with the left hydrocoel and the left stomatocoel they have further subsequently fused to form the adult rudiment. The formation of the rudiment has overall taken some time, giving rise first to a pentaradial disc and then to a pentaradial complex structure harboring podia (i.e. tube feet) and spines. In parallel, on the right size of the larva, a variable number of pedicellariae (one to four) and endoskeletal elements (i.e. the five genital plates) have further formed, which will also later contribute to the composition of the adult body."

The rudiment further harbors by now five long primary podia (i.e. tube feet), five quartets of definitive spines located between the primary podia and five pairs of immature spines at the basis of the primary podia, while on the opposite side, i.e. on the right side of the larva, five to seven immature spines have further developed, supported by the genital plates, along with one to four pedicaellariae. At the level of the larva, in parallel, the anterior and posterior pairs of epaulettes have also considerably increased in size by now and even fused dorsally to the hydropore and to the anus respectively, thereby leaving exempt of cilia two lateral fields in between them. At the center of the left lateral field, the vestibular roof has also by now ruptured and this opening has created the vestibular pore, through which some primary podia of the rudiment protrude outside the larva and scrutinize the substrate looking for the adequate cues to begin metamorphosis. At that stage, the larva is thus exhibiting a typical substrate-test behavior, going to the sea bottom and scrutinizing the substrate. This behavior is characteristic of a larva named competent to metamorphosis, which it will accomplish providing that it is adequately stimulated by environmental factors. "

def: "The metamorphic larva stage consists essentially of the evagination of the echinoid rudiment. It is characterized by the execution of conspicuous and relatively abrupt physical changes that take place quite quickly, in about one hour, and during which the planktonic larva is transformed into a benthic juvenile. At that stage, the larva is settled on the substrate and is firmly attached to it by the primary podia of the rudiment. The ectodermal epithelium of its arms has started to collapse, making the spicules supporting the larval arms piercing through the epidermis. The larval mouth and anus have further closed, while in parallel, within the larva, the rudiment spines have lifted up thereby distending the vestibular wall and wide opening the vestibular pore. Following these movements, the rudiment has farther down accomplished and finalized its complete eversion, encapsulating the digestive tract and reaching the right side of the larval body. During this process, the genital plates and the associated pedicellariae and immature spines present on the right side of the larva have further completed the production of the aboral part of the adult body. At the end of metamorphosis, hence at the end of the metamorphic larva stage, the individual has thus become benthic, it is settled in the substrate, and it looks like an adult pentaradial sea urchin although it is smaller in size, deprived of a functional digestive system and sexually immature.

def: "The postlarval juvenile is morphologically similar to both the late rudiment and an early sea urchin adult. Like the rudiment, it harbors five primary podia (or tube feet), five quartet of definitive spines, five pairs of immature spines located at the basis of the primary podia, 5 to 7 immature spines supported by the genital plates as well as 1 to 4 pedicellariae. Like the adult, it displays a pentarial symmetry and is settled on the substrate. The postlarva is about 300 µm in diameter. On its aboral side, it still exhibits some remaining larval rods and tissues, although these will soon disappear. In addition, the plates forming its endoskeleton are still rather light and porous making it looking relatively clear, although it bears lots of red-pigmented cells. However, the postlarva is still deprived of a mouth and an anus, hence of a functional digestive tract. The postlarva juvenile is thus endotrophic, meaning that its growth and development solely relies on energy derived from internal sources. Furthermore, the postlarva is sexually immature."

comment: temporal 18degC  +/- 8d after metamorphosis 
def: "The exotrophic juvenile really looks like a small adult. The plates of its endoskeleton have by now densified providing it with a dark shell. In addition, it has finally developed a functional digestive tract. The digestive tract inherited from the larva has indeed by now undergone a complete reorganization, progressively bending within the perivisceral cavity to form two successive loops. The buccal plates and the aristotle lantern have further finished developing, creating a new mouth that has opened on the oral side at the center of the aristotle's lantern, while a new anus has also opened in the periproct, i.e. at the center of the five genital plates. This juvenile can thus by now feed and start growing in size, by grazing on the substrate. This juvenile is thus exotrophic, meaning that its growth and development rely on energy derived from external sources. In addition, the primary podia have started to regress by that stage and will eventually disappear, while secondary podia have emerged and are functional, allowing the juvenile to move. Similarly, the immature spines have also started to be lost and be replaced by definitive spines. The genital plate CD has further differentiated into the madreporite and sphaeridia have formed. However, this individual is still sexually immature."
