This bending inward has by means generated the blastopore, i.e. the first opening of the embryo that will later give rise to the larval anus. Furthermore, it initiated the invagination of the archenteron (i.e. the primitive digestive tract). In sea urchin, this initial process is hence launched by the non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells.

A second phase of archenteron elongation has taken place by invagination of additional cells into the blastocoel, by cell division or by convergent-extension movements depending on the sea urchin species. Non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells that are present at the tip of the archenteron have further started ingressing into the blastocoel, generating the non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells (or NSM cells, secondary mesenchyme cells or SMC). The oral ectoderm has also started to flatten and to become thicker, providing the first morphological indicator of the oral-aboral (or ventro-dorsal) axis of the embryo. As a consequence the oral chain formed by a portion of the skeletogenic mesenchyme cells has also flattened. Finally, skeletal calcification has further begun within the skeletogenic mesenchyme ventrolateral clusters, marked by the presence of the first calcified structures, which appear as small dots at that stage.

def: "The embryo is mainly characterized morphologically by the presence in the blastocoel of a fully extended archenteron (i.e. primitive digestive tract) that has now reached the roof of the blastocoel. The third and last extension phase of the archenteron has been ensured by pulling forces exerted by non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells that are still present at the tip of the archenteron. These cells have produced filopodia that extended towards the animal pole, attached the wall, and then shortened, thereby pulling up the archenteron. In some sea urchin species, this pulling force is already orienting the tip of the archenteron towards the oral ectoderm, where the future mouth of the larvae will form. In parallel, in the blastocoel, additional non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells continued ingressing from the tip of the archenteron and the skeletal calcified structures present in the skeletogenic mesenchyme ventrolateral clusters have further grown, forming now the primary triradiate skeletal rudiments (or spicules).

def: "The embryo is mainly characterized morphologically by a typical triangular shape, the beginning of the tripatition of the digestive tract and the presence of pigmented cells. The oral (or ventral) ectoderm has by now even more flattened, making an almost perfect right angle with the blastoporal side of the embryo. By contrast, on the opposite side, the aboral (or dorsal) ectoderm has round up and slightly elongated, thereby forming the primitive apex of the future larvae. These changes have conferred the embryo a typical and easy recognizable triangular shape. In the oral ectoderm, a small depression has further appeared, called the stomodeum, which will later fuse with the tip of the archenteron to form the mouth. In the blastocoel, the digestive tract has also by now bended toward the stomodeum and started to become tripartite. The cardiac sphincter has started forming, separating the future esophagus from the future stomach. The triradiate spicules have also continued elongating, thereby forming by now, towards the animal pole, the right and left dorsoventral connecting rods, towards the apex, the body rods, and along the vegetal, oral ectoderm the left and right ventral transverse rods. Moreover, some non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells (or NSM cells, secondary mesenchyme cells or SMC) have started becoming pigmented and inserted into the aboral ectoderm. These cells represent part of the future immune system of the larvae along with other blastocoelar cells that are present in the blastocoel around the gut. In the vicinity of the future esophagus, other non-skeletogenic mesoderm descendant cells along with some endoderm cells have further arranged to form a single unpaired coelomic pouch. At the animal pole, the apical pole domain has also started to flatten making the embryo look like a square when viewed from the oral side, and it still arbors a tuft a long and immotile cilia. Finally, within the apical pole domain, but not yet in the ciliary band, molecular labeling surveys also start by this stage to reveal the presence of differentiating neuronal cells. "

The first morphological indicator of a left-right asymmetry becomes apparent at that stage, the left coelomic pouch being slightly more elongated than the right one. Furthermore, a thin protrusion of non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells can be seen extending from the left coelomic pouch to the anterior ectoderm. This is the primary pore canal, which opens to the exterior environment by the hydropore.

def: "The 8-arm pluteus larva is mainly characterized morphologically by the presence on the ventral side of the larva of eight arms and by the development within the larva, on the left side of the stomach, of the adult rudiment. This stage is relatively long. It includes distinct changes occurring to the larva as well as within the larva, although the larva consistently exhibits 8 arms. In addition, it should be highlighted that the sequence of events taking place at the level of the larva compared to that occurring on the left side of the stomach to form the rudiment are heterochronic, meaning that differences are observed among individuals in the relative timing of these events. From the larval point of view, at that stage, on the anterior side, the dorsal arch has extended out of the oral hood, thereby forming two additional arms above the mouth, i.e. the preoral arms. In parallel, across the apex, the epaulettes have continued developing, thereby generating four large structures rich in cilia and perpendicular to the ventro-dorsal axis. At the tip of the apex, the suture of the body rods has also eventually ruptured, considerably enlarging the larval apex and reducing the angle between the postoral and posterodorsal arms. In parallel, inside the larva, the left coelomic pouch has also by now been partitioned into three parts: the axocoel (upper part, close to the esophagus), the hydrocoel (middle part) and the somatocoel (lower part, next to the stomach). Likewise, on the opposite side, the right coelomic pouch has also been partitioned into a right axohydrocoel and a right somatocoel, although the right axohydrocoel remains in a rudimentary state compared to its left counterparts. In addition, at the basis of the posterodorsal arm on the left side, a small portion of the ectoderm has thickened, invaginated, and came into contact with the left hydocoel. This structure is called the vestibule and together with the left hydrocoel and the left stomatocoel they have further subsequently fused to form the adult rudiment. The formation of the rudiment has overall taken some time, giving rise first to a pentaradial disc and then to a pentaradial complex structure harboring podia (i.e. tube feet) and spines. In parallel, on the right size of the larva, a variable number of pedicellariae (one to four) and endoskeletal elements (i.e. the five genital plates) have further formed, which will also later contribute to the composition of the adult body."

At the level of the larva, in parallel, the anterior and posterior pairs of epaulettes have also considerably increased in size by now and even fused dorsally to the hydropore and to the anus respectively, thereby leaving exempt of cilia two lateral fields in between them. At the center of the left lateral field, the vestibular roof has also by now ruptured and this opening has created the vestibular pore, through which some primary podia of the rudiment protrude outside the larva and scrutinize the substrate looking for the adequate cues to begin metamorphosis. At that stage, the larva is thus exhibiting a typical substrate-test behavior, going to the sea bottom and scrutinizing the substrate. This behavior is characteristic of a larva named competent to metamorphosis, which it will accomplish providing that it is adequately stimulated by environmental factors. "

def: "The metamorphic larva stage consists essentially of the evagination of the echinoid rudiment. It is characterized by the execution of conspicuous and relatively abrupt physical changes that take place quite quickly, in about one hour, and during which the planktonic larva is transformed into a benthic juvenile. At that stage, the larva is settled on the substrate and is firmly attached to it by the primary podia of the rudiment. The ectodermal epithelium of its arms has started to collapse, making the spicules supporting the larval arms piercing through the epidermis. The larval mouth and anus have further closed, while in parallel, within the larva, the rudiment spines have lifted up thereby distending the vestibular wall and wide opening the vestibular pore. Following these movements, the rudiment has farther down accomplished and finalized its complete eversion, encapsulating the digestive tract and reaching the right side of the larval body. During this process, the genital plates and the associated pedicellariae and immature spines present on the right side of the larva have further completed the production of the aboral part of the adult body. At the end of metamorphosis, hence at the end of the metamorphic larva stage, the individual has thus become benthic, it is settled in the substrate, and it looks like an adult pentaradial sea urchin although it is smaller in size, deprived of a functional digestive system and sexually immature.

On its aboral side, it still exhibits some remaining larval rods and tissues, although these will soon disappear. In addition, the plates forming its endoskeleton are still rather light and porous making it looking relatively clear, although it bears lots of red-pigmented cells. However, the postlarva is still deprived of a mouth and an anus, hence of a functional digestive tract.
