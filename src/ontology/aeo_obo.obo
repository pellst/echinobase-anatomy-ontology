The fourth cleavage took place simultaneously in the animal and the vegetal hemisphere, although it occurred differently. In the animal hemisphere, the four cells divided meridionally producing eight blastomeres of equal volume and arrayed in rosette. These cells are called the mesomeres. In the vegetal hemisphere, by contrast, the four cells underwent an unequal, equatorial cleavage that produced four large cells, the macromeres, and four small cells, the micromeres. At the 16-cell stage, the embryo is hence composed of three groups of cells with distinct sizes. It represents, in most sea urchin species, the first embryonic stage at which the first morphological indicator of the animal-vegetal axis becomes visible, with the smallest cells marking the vegetal pole.

In the animal hemisphere, the mesomeres underwent an equal and equatorial cleavage, thereby giving rise to two animal cell tiers, each composed of eight blastomeres of equal size: the an1 tier located at the animal pole and the an2 tier located below an1. In parallel, the macromeres divided meridionally, thereby forming a ring of eight cells of equal volume located below the an2 tier.

By contrast, underneath, the macromeres divided equatorially and equally, thus generating two vegetal cell tiers, each composed of 8 cells of equal volume, namely the veg1 tier (located below an2) and the veg2 tier (located below veg1 and above the large micromeres). At that stage, the large and small micromeres have not undergone a sixth division yet.

In addition, it should be highlighted that the sequence of events taking place at the level of the larva compared to that occurring on the left side of the stomach to form the rudiment are heterochronic, meaning that differences are observed among individuals in the relative timing of these events. From the larval point of view, at that stage, on the anterior side, the dorsal arch has extended out of the oral hood, thereby forming two additional arms above the mouth, i.e. the preoral arms. In parallel, across the apex, the epaulettes have continued developing, thereby generating four large structures rich in cilia and perpendicular to the ventro-dorsal axis. At the tip of the apex, the suture of the body rods has also eventually ruptured, considerably enlarging the larval apex and reducing the angle between the postoral and posterodorsal arms. In parallel, inside the larva, the left coelomic pouch has also by now been partitioned into three parts: the axocoel (upper part, close to the esophagus), the hydrocoel (middle part) and the somatocoel (lower part, next to the stomach). Likewise, on the opposite side, the right coelomic pouch has also been partitioned into a right axohydrocoel and a right somatocoel, although the right axohydrocoel remains in a rudimentary state compared to its left counterparts.

This structure is called the vestibule and together with the left hydrocoel and the left stomatocoel they have further subsequently fused to form the adult rudiment. The formation of the rudiment has overall taken some time, giving rise first to a pentaradial disc and then to a pentaradial complex structure harboring podia (i.e. tube feet) and spines. In parallel, on the right size of the larva, a variable number of pedicellariae (one to four) and endoskeletal elements (i.e. the five genital plates) have further formed, which will also later contribute to the composition of the adult body."

The rudiment further harbors by now five long primary podia (i.e. tube feet), five quartets of definitive spines located between the primary podia and five pairs of immature spines at the basis of the primary podia, while on the opposite side, i.e. on the right side of the larva, five to seven immature spines have further developed, supported by the genital plates, along with one to four pedicaellariae. At the level of the larva, in parallel, the anterior and posterior pairs of epaulettes have also considerably increased in size by now and even fused dorsally to the hydropore and to the anus respectively, thereby leaving exempt of cilia two lateral fields in between them. At the center of the left lateral field, the vestibular roof has also by now ruptured and this opening has created the vestibular pore, through which some primary podia of the rudiment protrude outside the larva and scrutinize the substrate looking for the adequate cues to begin metamorphosis. At that stage, the larva is thus exhibiting a typical substrate-test behavior, going to the sea bottom and scrutinizing the substrate. This behavior is characteristic of a larva named competent to metamorphosis, which it will accomplish providing that it is adequately stimulated by environmental factors. "

def: "The metamorphic larva stage consists essentially of the evagination of the echinoid rudiment. It is characterized by the execution of conspicuous and relatively abrupt physical changes that take place quite quickly, in about one hour, and during which the planktonic larva is transformed into a benthic juvenile. At that stage, the larva is settled on the substrate and is firmly attached to it by the primary podia of the rudiment. The ectodermal epithelium of its arms has started to collapse, making the spicules supporting the larval arms piercing through the epidermis. The larval mouth and anus have further closed, while in parallel, within the larva, the rudiment spines have lifted up thereby distending the vestibular wall and wide opening the vestibular pore. Following these movements, the rudiment has farther down accomplished and finalized its complete eversion, encapsulating the digestive tract and reaching the right side of the larval body. During this process, the genital plates and the associated pedicellariae and immature spines present on the right side of the larva have further completed the production of the aboral part of the adult body. At the end of metamorphosis, hence at the end of the metamorphic larva stage, the individual has thus become benthic, it is settled in the substrate, and it looks like an adult pentaradial sea urchin although it is smaller in size, deprived of a functional digestive system and sexually immature.

comment: temporal 18degC right after metamorphosis(i.e. between 18d to 25d depending on the food supplied)
def: "The postlarval juvenile is morphologically similar to both the late rudiment and an early sea urchin adult. Like the rudiment, it harbors five primary podia (or tube feet), five quartet of definitive spines, five pairs of immature spines located at the basis of the primary podia, 5 to 7 immature spines supported by the genital plates as well as 1 to 4 pedicellariae. Like the adult, it displays a pentarial symmetry and is settled on the substrate. The postlarva is about 300 µm in diameter. On its aboral side, it still exhibits some remaining larval rods and tissues, although these will soon disappear. In addition, the plates forming its endoskeleton are still rather light and porous making it looking relatively clear, although it bears lots of red-pigmented cells. However, the postlarva is still deprived of a mouth and an anus, hence of a functional digestive tract. The postlarva juvenile is thus endotrophic, meaning that its growth and development solely relies on energy derived from internal sources. Furthermore, the postlarva is sexually immature."

comment: temporal 18degC  +/- 8d after metamorphosis 
def: "The exotrophic juvenile really looks like a small adult. The plates of its endoskeleton have by now densified providing it with a dark shell. In addition, it has finally developed a functional digestive tract. The digestive tract inherited from the larva has indeed by now undergone a complete reorganization, progressively bending within the perivisceral cavity to form two successive loops. The buccal plates and the aristotle lantern have further finished developing, creating a new mouth that has opened on the oral side at the center of the aristotle's lantern, while a new anus has also opened in the periproct, i.e. at the center of the five genital plates. This juvenile can thus by now feed and start growing in size, by grazing on the substrate. This juvenile is thus exotrophic, meaning that its growth and development rely on energy derived from external sources. In addition, the primary podia have started to regress by that stage and will eventually disappear, while secondary podia have emerged and are functional, allowing the juvenile to move. Similarly, the immature spines have also started to be lost and be replaced by definitive spines. The genital plate CD has further differentiated into the madreporite and sphaeridia have formed. However, this individual is still sexually immature."
